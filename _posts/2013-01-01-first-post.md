Welcome to maptimePDX! Maptime is a place and space for making maps, talking about maps, and geeking out on all things techy and spatial. Maptime was borne out of the [MaptimeSF group](http://maptimesf.tumblr.com/) as a way to get map nerds together and just hack out some ideas not yet realized. We aim to keep that up and make a easy space for you to bring your ideas, questions, and learn learn learn! Please check the front page for the upcoming events and get ready to start mapping.

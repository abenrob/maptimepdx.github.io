**What**: A meetup for hacking on map stuff.

**Where**: [Esri R&D Center](http://calagator.org/venues/202393267)

**When**: Thursday, January 16, 2014 from 6â€“8:30pm

[Matt](https://twitter.com/mattsayler) and I are gearing up for another great year for **maptimePDX** and thanks to [Lyzi Diamond](https://twitter.com/lyzidiamond), we're off to a great start! [First maptime](http://calagator.org/events/1250465361) of the year will be at the familiar digs over at [Esri R&D Center (aka Geoloqi HQ)](http://calagator.org/venues/202393267) like last time.

The agenda is up to you but there are a couple of fun tasks that some of you can help out with if you're up for learning some new things. I'd like to throw out two things I'd like to share and potentially hack on: [this Jekyll site](https://github.com/geografa/maptimepdx/tree/gh-pages) and the [OSM Bright Quickstart](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/).

So bring your ideas and an appetite to learn and contribute. Some bevvies and snacks provided. See you then!

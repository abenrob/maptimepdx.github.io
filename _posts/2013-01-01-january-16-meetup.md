**What**: A meetup for hacking on map stuff.

**Where**: [Esri R&D Center](http://calagator.org/venues/202393267)

**When**: Thursday, January 16, 2014 from 6â€“8:30pm

[Matt](https://twitter.com/mattsayler) and I are gearing up for another great year for **maptimePDX** and thanks to [Lyzi Diamond](https://twitter.com/lyzidiamond), we're off to a great start! [First maptime](http://calagator.org/events/1250465361) of the year will be at the familiar digs over at [Esri R&D Center (aka Geoloqi HQ)](http://calagator.org/venues/202393267) like last time.

The agenda is up to you but there are a couple of fun tasks that some of you can help out with if you're up for learning some new things. I'd like to throw out two things I'd like to share and potentially hack on: [this Jekyll site](https://github.com/geografa/maptimepdx/tree/gh-pages) and the [OSM Bright Quickstart](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/).

So bring your ideas and an appetite to learn and contribute. Some bevvies and snacks provided. See you then!

### Intros and things we're working on
Matt and I kicked off the new year with a super casual Maptime event. Nothing flashy, just intros of new folks interested in all the geo/dev stuff happening in Portland at the moment. Esri R&D were gracious enough to host the meetup and we settled in the space comfortably. We're still feeling out the audience so we're all ears in what you're up for getting into. Lightening talks, hack sessions, mentor-matching...it's up to you. Next event will have at least a brief intro talk and break out with respective interest groups.
